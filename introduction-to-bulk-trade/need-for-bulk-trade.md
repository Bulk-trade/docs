# Need for Bulk Trade

DeFi has always been envisioned as the pinnacle use case of crypto—bringing finance fully on-chain to make it **scalable, transparent, and verifiable**. However, much of DeFi today has failed to deliver on this promise.

One of the biggest flaws in DeFi is the **pseudo-centralization of liquidity**. Consider what happens when liquidity provided by market makers disappears—DEXs struggle, slippage worsens, and markets become inefficient.

#### **The Missing Piece in DeFi**

We believe the core issues in DeFi today stem from a lack of:

* **Permissionless market access**
* **Verifiability of liquidity sources**
* **Institutional-grade liquidity**, similar to what’s available on centralized exchanges (CEXs)

BULK provides the **infrastructure and liquidity stack** needed to power the next generation of financial applications—perpetual and spot exchanges—without relying on traditional liquidity commitments.

#### **Why Bulk Trade?**

At its core, a DEX is only as strong as its **liquidity, execution speed, and price efficiency**. Users will always choose a platform that provides:

* **Better pricing for trades**
* **Lower slippage**
* **Deep, available liquidity for any order size**

To enable these, BULK introduces two key innovations:

1. **BULK Liquidity Network** – A decentralized liquidity layer optimizing capital efficiency.
2. **BULK Book** – A hyper-efficient order book that rivals CEX-level execution.

***

### **The Evolution of Market Making**

Just as DeFi has shifted from **CEXs to DEXs**—with nearly 60% of Solana's volume now routed through on-chain order books—we are now witnessing the next evolution: a move towards **decentralized, high-performance liquidity primitives**.

#### **WTF is Market Making?**

CEXs operate on **order book models** but do not have built-in liquidity reserves like AMM-based DEXs. Instead, they **rely on market participants (market makers) to provide liquidity** by continuously placing buy and sell orders.

**How do Market Makers profit?**

* They **strategically place orders** to earn the spread between bid and ask prices.
* They **actively manage liquidity**, unlike AMMs that rely on fixed pricing formulas.
* They ensure **efficient pricing and deep liquidity** to keep markets liquid.

**Key Differences from AMMs:**

✅ **Actively managed liquidity** (not passive like AMMs)\
✅ **No x\*y=k pricing model** (prices are spread-driven)\
✅ **Higher potential rewards for liquidity providers**\
✅ **Millions of trades executed efficiently, maintaining deep liquidity**

### **Why Solana Needs Market Makers**

Solana is experiencing a **surge in on-chain order books**—from **Drift to Phoenix**—and BULK is betting on Solana’s continued rise as a high-performance blockchain with increased **block size and lower latency**.

As Solana grows, we expect **more protocols powered by in-house order books**, including:

* **Lending protocols**
* **Spot exchanges**
* **Real-world assets (RWAs)**

This growth **demands a robust liquidity layer**, but the challenge is **allowing everyday users to become market makers**—a role traditionally reserved for sophisticated participants due to:

* **Complexity in liquidity management**
* **Custody risks**
* **High capital requirements**

#### **How BULK Solves This**

BULK democratizes liquidity provision by:

1. **Aggregating user liquidity in a non-custodial environment** to execute market-making strategies.
2. **Providing deep liquidity to protocols**, ensuring smooth order execution for their users.
3. **Generating revenue from spreads, rebates, and trading fees**, benefiting both users and protocols.

BULK transforms **user liquidity into high-definition, network-owned liquidity**, making it a **core pillar for DeFi’s next evolution**.

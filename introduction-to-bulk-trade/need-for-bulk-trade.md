# Need for Bulk Trade

DeFi has always been the pinnacle use-case of crypto, to bring finance fully on-chain. Make finance more scalable, transparent, verifiable. However, most of DeFi has arguably failed on this promise. DeFi today is psudo centralistion of liquidity - think what happens when liquidity provided by market makers goes away.&#x20;

So what's lacking in DeFi? We believe it's the lack of permissionlessness, verifiability and most importantly high grade liqudity similar to instituonions or Liquidity avalible on CEXs. BULK bundles the infrastructure and liquidity stack required to power these defi apps i.e perputual, spot exhanges. Today most of dexes relay on liquidity commitments to make their DAPP work. First and foresmost users will always use a dapp that has better pricing on trading, better slippage and avaible liqudity for their choice of order. Bulk offers 2 key innovations to make markets liquid. These protocols are the BULK Liquidity Network, and the BULK Book.\
\
We belive that as we had a shift from CEXs to DEXs, now almost 60% of volume is being routed through DEXs (atleast on solana) There is a necseassry market revolution to shift to better liquidity primitives that are desentralised and as powerful. People talk about Market makers but lets breakdown what market making is:\


~~The Spicenet Liquidity Network provides a unified and composable liquidity layer, one that is free of fragmentation, and is fueled by Flashbooks: the flagship Intent-AMM orderbooks sourcing liquidity from Spicenet's Network-Owned Liquidity initiative and external liquidity sources via intents. By enshrining liquidity at the network level, Spicenet ensures applications can inherit this liquidity for their use-case, without ever fragmenting liquidity. In fact, as more applications join Spicenet, liquidity becomes more productive, driving better yield for LPs(solvers and Network-Owned Liquidity vaults).~~

## Wtf is Market Making?

Cexs are built on something called a Orderbook but they dont have a liquidity reserve like AMMs based DEXs. So Cexs relay on market participants to bring in the liquidity (orders) for markets. Some highly innovative market participants sole job is to provide liquidity by filling the orders. how do they make money? by placing strategic orders they make money on spreads. \
key notes that deffer from most amms:

* Liqudity is actively managed here
* No x=k\*y pricing model&#x20;
* Assets are priced based on spread and market
* higher potential for rewards
* CEXs stay liquid handling millions of trades&#x20;

Why do we need MMs on solana?

Defi on solana is seeing an uptrend of onchain orderbooks from drift to phoneix and BULK is taking a bet as solana grows as a powerhouse increase block sizes and reducing latences we are anticipting more protocols powered by their in house orderbooks.&#x20;

So how do we MM on soalna without the need of high frequency infrastrucutre or market knowledge&#x20;





The Open Exchange Protocol is a module boilerplate allowing applications to customize and choose from a variety of collateral assets, markets and instruments. Applications can therefore be highly opinionated and heterogenous, being selective about the collateral they want to support, markets they want to feature, and type of instruments they desire(spot, futures, etc). The Open Exchange Protocol also features a fully integrated money market, and a state-of-art risk engine, designed to price risk effectively. By abstracting the infrastructure and liquidity workloads from apps, Spicenet promotes permissionless finance and unlocks innovation at the application layer.

The end goal of Spicenet is to cultivate a flourishing ecosystem of trading applications, utilizing a shared liquidity layer, and benefitting off of open and customizable exchange/risk infrastructure. DeFi integrations are also directly built into the chain, in the form of expanded collateral, native USDC issuance, and so on, allowing apps to fully focus on their product, GTM and user acquisition.
